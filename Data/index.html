<ul>
<li>of a relationship type is the number of participating entity types.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>cardinality ratio</p>

<ul>
<li>specifies the maximum number of relationship instances that an entity can
participate in.  (1:1), (1:N), (M:N), (N:1)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>participation constraint</p>

<ul>
<li>specifies whether the existence of an entity depends on its being related
to another entity via the relationship type.  This constraint specifies
the minimum number of relationship instances that each entity can
participate in and is also called the minimum cardinality constraint.
Two types:
<ul>
<li>total participation OR existence dependency
<ul>
<li>every entity in the total set of employee entities must be related
to a department entity via WORKS_FOR</li>
</ul></li>
<li>partial participation
<ul>
<li>some or part of the set of employee entities are related to some
department entity via MANAGES, but not necessarily all.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>weak entity types</p>

<ul>
<li>entity types that do not have key attributes of their own</li>
<li>it always has a total participation constraint with respect to its
identifying relationship because a weak entity cannot be identified
without an owner identity.</li>
<li>normally has a partial key</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>regular entity types OR strong entity types</p>

<ul>
<li>entity types that do have key attributes</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>identifying relationship</p>

<ul>
<li>the relationship type that relates a weak entity type to its owner</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>partial key</p>

<ul>
<li>the set of attributes that can uniquely identify weak entities that are
related to the same owner entity</li>
</ul></li>

<h3>3.1 Using High-level Conceptual Data Models for Database Design</h3>

<p>// insert Figure 3.1</p>

<p>The conceptual schema does not include implementation details</p>

<h3>3.2 An Example Database Application</h3>

<p>// Nothing to see here</p>

<h3>3.3 Entity Types, Entity Sets, Attributes, and Keys</h3>

<p>There are several types of attributes:
- simple versus composite
- single valued versus multivalued
- stored versus derived</p>

<h4>Simple versus Composite Attributes</h4>

<p>Simple are also called atomic attributes</p>

<p>Simple attributes are ones that cannot be further divided. Composite attributes
form a hierarchy. E.g. street_address can be subdivided into number, street, and
apt number</p>

<h4>Single-Valued versus Multivalued Attributes</h4>

<p>Single-valued attributes can have only a single value for any particular entity.
E.g. age</p>

<p>Multi-valued attributes can have a set of values for any particular attribute.
There many be upper and lower constraints on the number of attributes.  They are
specified with braces and comma separated values</p>

<h4>Stored versus Derived Attributes</h4>

<p>E.g. age can be derived from date of birth. The age attribute is the <em>derived
attribute</em> and is said to be <em>derivable from</em> the date of birth
attribute.  The date of birth attribute is then the <em>stored attribute</em></p>

<h4>Null Values</h4>

<ul>
<li>unknown value
<ul>
<li>the value exists but is not recorded</li>
<li>it is not known whether the attribute value exists.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Complex Attributes</h4>

<p>Specified by grouping attributes with a set of parenthesis and separating
attributes with a comma.</p>

<h4>Key Attributes of an Entity Type</h4>

<p>key attribute names are underlined in the ER diagram</p>

<h4>Value Sets (Domains) of Attributes</h4>

<p>// Nothing too interesting here</p>

<h3>3.4 Relationship Types, Relationship Sets, Roles, and Structural Constraints</h3>

<p>Relationships are displayed with diamond shaped boxes.</p>

<p>Binary relationships ( or relationships with two entities ) are the most common</p>

<p>There are two main types of relationship constraints:
    - cardinality ratio
    - participation</p>

<p>The two of these combined are called <em>structural constraints</em> of a
relationship type.</p>

<h3>3.5 Weak Entity Types</h3>

<p>// Nothing here, just definitions.</p>

<h3>3.6 Refining the ER Design for the COMPANY Database</h3>

<p>// Nothing</p>

<h3>3.7 ER Diagrams, Naming Conventions, and Design Issues</h3>

<h4><em>Alternative</em> ER notation for structural constraints on relationships</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>This notation involves associating a pair of integer numbers (min, max) with
each participation of an entity type E in a relationship type R, where </p>

<pre><code>0 &lt;= min&lt;= max and max = 1
</code></pre>

<p>The numbers mean that for each entity e in E, e must
participate in at least min and at most max relationship instances in R at any
point in time. In this method, min = 0 implies partial participation, whereas
min > 0 implies total participation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hint: I prefer the alternative notation</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usually, one uses either the cardinality ratio/single-line/double-line
notation or the (min, max) notation. The (min, max) notation is more precise,
and we can use it to specify structural constraints for relationship types of
any degree. However, it is not sufficient for specifying some key constraints
on higher-degree relation-ships, as discussed in Section 3.9</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As discussed in class</p>
