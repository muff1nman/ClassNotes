## ACID

- Atomicity
    - database needs to perform operations that are atomic
    - all or nothing, can't be broken down
    - Entirely succeeds or fails
- Consistency
    - every transaction leaves the database in a valid state
- Isolation
    - independent
    - all transactions, especially during concurrency, must execute in
      isolation
- Durability
    - Once a transaction is done, the results are permanent
