1. What is the importance of diminishing marginal returns in the neoclassical
   model? How do other models deal with the possibility of diminishing returns?
    -  The Cobb-Douglas function as illustrated in Appendix A1 gives the
       following general function

            Y = A * K^a * L^b

       Where the upper case letters A, K and L represent the technology scale
       (exogenous), capital, and labor, respectively.  The lower case letters
       alpha and beta represent the nature of scale for the economy.  If
       increasing labor for a factor of 2 quadruples the output then the value
       of beta would be 2.  The following summarizes
       
       - <code>a + b = 1</code> : constant returns to scale
       - <code>a + b > 1</code> : increasing returns to scale
       - <code>a + b < 1</code> : diminishing returns to scale

    - A simplification of this function is the following:

            Y = A * K^a * L^(1-a)

      Where <code>0 < a < 1</code> which demonstrates that capital and labor
      have diminishing returns to production. Taking a derivative of this
      function in regards to K demonstrates further that the marginal product of
      capital will fall. The return to production can only be a constant scalar
      of capital and labor if both increase at the same rate.

    - Capital (K) is accumulated by a fraction (s) of production (Y) that is
      saved. It is decreased by a constant depreciation term (sigma) times the
      current amount of capital, or in other words:

            dK / dt = s*Y - sigma*K

      So therefore, capital only increases when savings is greater than
      depreciation.

    - In addition the equation above has a derivative equation of the form:

            dk / dt = s*y - (sigma + n) * k

      Where the lower case terms correspond to their uppercase terms except as a
      per worker basis.  This equation shows that in addition to a depreciation
      value there is also a sense of "upkeep" per population.

    - Results from changing variables
        - s
            - if the savings is changed, the benefit will be short-term and the
              output per worker (y) will increase until the change in capital
              accumulation settles back at zero. There is a point at which
              increases in capital will no longer benefit and that is the golden
              rule.
        - n
            - increases in population will increase the dilution of capital and
              in turn decrease capital per worker, decreasing output per worker
              (y)
    - For the AK model, it is assumed that there are no diminishing returns to
      capital [225]
    - For the Knowledge Externality Model, the individual firms face the same
      diminishing production function for investments in knowledge similar to
      the neoclassical model, but for the economy as a whole, the production
      function is constant and changes to knowledge affect the economy
      at a long term overall.
    - The Human Capital Model is similar to the AK model in that there are no
      diminishing returns.
    - For the CD and R&D models as long as labor supplied to the effort of
      researching technology is constant that the returns to technology are
      constant. However, the effectiveness of R&D may have diminishing returns
      based on pas R&D
5. Is more competition good for economic growth?
    - long-run economic growth cannot be supported by capital investment alone
      and needs growth in technology
    - A firm would innovate if it has the opportunity to increase its profits 232
    - It may stunt the R&D effectiveness
    - Dynamic Competition
        - without competition the incumbent firms have lower incentives to
          innovate and thus it is expected that economic growth decreases.
        - with too much competetion, if the number of firms is reduced, the R&D
          per firm increases which leads to more innovations.  Note that this
          depends on whether there are economies of scale or not.
    - Static Competition
        - If static competition is increased, then a firm's profits are lower
          which lowers the incentives to innovate which lower economic growth
          which is the immediate effect.
        - Another take is that there are firm inefficencies without static
          competition and thus increasing this competition forces a form to
          reduce these inefficiencies and increase innovativiness.
