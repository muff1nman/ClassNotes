<p>Key Questions
  What drives innovation?
  How does intellectual property influence innovation?
  Which economic systems and market structures yield more or better innovations?
  Does innovation replace jobs and lead to higher unemployment?
  What role does innovation play in the wealth or poverty of a nation?
  Is economic regulation good or bad for innovation?</p>

<p>What is the 'economics of innovation'?
  Microeconomics - understanding processes including how incentives affect firms</p>

<p>Marcroeconomics - 'innovation' drives economic growth.. and economic growth
  drives living standards, environmental and political ...</p>

<p>Economic Policy - ar there market failures in the innovation process and what
  if anything should the government do?</p>

<p>Business Strategy - this is not a course on advisin firms how to innovate, but
  does include some insigh into this.</p>

<p>Invention and innovation
  What do we mean by invention and innovation?
    invention - the advent of new knowledge - creation of an idea to do or make
    something ( profitablility not yet verified )</p>

<pre><code>innovation - the implementation of that invention in the market.  Really
bringing it out to the world - new product / process commercially valuable,
i.e. successfully developed inventions.

Example - apple didn't invent the tablet but did bring it successfully to
market
</code></pre>

<p>Definition of Innovation
  Basic Def
    Introduction of new ideas that add 'value' to a firm's activities
  OECD the Oslo Manual
    - Introduction of a new product or a qualitative change in an existing product
    - process innovation new to an industry
    - the opening of a new market
    - development of new sources of supply for raw materials or other inputs
    - changes in industrial organization</p>

<p>Business ahs only two functions, innovation and marketing. -- Peter F. Drucker</p>

</ol>

<ol>
<li>Adoption or purchase decision</li>
<li>Market Penetration</li>
<li>Adaption Improvement ---> back to 7 or 9</li>
</ol>

<h2>Role of technology</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>What does new technology contribute to the economy?
Improves <em>prductivity</em> leading to...
    economic growth which means...
        increased social welfare (standard of living)</p></li>
<li><p>Productivity: output produced per unit of input</p>

<p>E.g. labor productiviey</p></li>
<li><p>How have you seen technology incorporated into economic models previously?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Production Function</h2>

<ul>
<li>Starting point for developing a supply curve for supply and demand model</li>
<li>Simple Cobb-Douglas prduction function //Missing Stuff</li>
</ul>

<h2>What do we see in the real world?</h2>

<p>Technology constant 'A' improves over time</p>

<p>//Missing graph</p>

<p>Increase in A shifts q to the left and down</p>

<h2>What is 'A'</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>A = Exogenous</em> technological progress (innovation)</li>
<li>In econ, technology is generally treated as an exogenous var (especially in
the past )</li>
<li>What does this mean?
<ul>
<li>We don't know why productivity increases </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is productivty increasing over time?</h2>

<p>Black Box !</p>

<h2>Microeconomics review</h2>

<p>// Missing graph</p>

<p>x axis -- quanity
y axis -- price
increasing sloped line -- supply
decreasing sloped line -- demand</p>

<ul>
<li>Can you label all the parts?</li>
<li>What does efficiency mean in this model?
<ul>
<li>Supply and demand are equal </li>
<li>Nothing is wasted</li>
<li>Right in the middle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What does equity mean in this model?
<ul>
<li>How fair things are?</li>
<li>Usually not included in economic models</li>
<li>Usually efficiency leads to equity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assuming perfect competition, where will the market end up?
<ul>
<li>Right in the middle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is teh invisible hand?
<ul>
<li>Drives the market to equilibrium</li>
<li>Adam Smith</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Other
- Demand curve slopes down
    - Diminshing margin  //Missing Stuff
- Demand curve flat
    - No matter the price demand is the same
    - Competition -> Market price determines price
- Supply curve slopes up</p>

<h2>Adam Smith</h2>

<ul>
<li>Invisible Hand
<ul>
<li>Markets tend to equilibrium on their own accord
<blockquote>
  <p>he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led
by an <em>invisible hand</em> to promote an end which was no part of his intention..
By pursuing his own interest he freqe //Missing stuff</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Invisible Hand</h2>
</blockquote>

Note that the eqil. that the market tend to move to _does not_ nec. have to be
an equil. where social wlefare is maxed.

<h2>Economic Models</h2>

*Always Ask*:
- What are the assumptions of the model?
- How might the model perform if the assumptions are changed?

<h2>Perfectly competive market model</h2>

*Assumptions of Perfect Competition*

<ul>
<li>No barriers to entry: Equal access to inputs and technology (i.e. patents)</li>
<li>Identical goods</li>
<li>Perfect information: All market particpants know prices (input prices, output
prices, etc)</li>
<li>Many buyers and sellers</li>
<li>No uncertainity </li>
<li>Firms are price takers (its actions cannot impact market price)</li>
<li>Transactions are costless</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Do all of these assumptions hold for high technology goods and services</em></p>

<h2>Market Structure</h2>

<h4>Perfect competition</h4>

<ul>
<li>commodities</li>
</ul>

<h4>Oligopoly ( Most markets )</h4>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft</li>
</ul>

<p>products are similar but still different</p>

<p>less sloped demand curve</p>

<h4>Monopoly</h4>

<ul>
<li>Exxcel? </li>
<li>Utilities (localized)? </li>
<li>PostalService </li>
<li>Military</li>
</ul>

<h4>Natural Monopoly</h4>

<ul>
<li>Utilities:  makes sense to have one firm in charge</li>
<li>Gravel Pit (localized again)</li>
</ul>

<h3>barriers to entry:</h3>

<ul>
<li>captial</li>
<li>reputation</li>
<li>legislative</li>
<li>patents</li>
<li>economies of scale (walmart)</li>
</ul>

<h3>barriers to exit:</h3>

<ul>
<li>cost to exit (mining companies)</li>
<li>sunk cost
<ul>
<li>these costs have to be taken care of before any money is made, in advance</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>What types of firm innovates</h2>

<h3>Perfectly Competitive firms?</h3>

<h4>No incentive</h4>

<h3>Stable Monopoly (natual or legislated)?</h3>

<h4>Little incentive</h4>

<h4>Some Research with their extra profits</h4>

<h3>Oligopolistic firms</h3>

<h4>Fertile ground for innovation!</h4>

<h2>The growth miracle of free-enterprise?</h2>

<p>Stock market crash - loans to people who could not afford - sell the loans
(which were overpriced)</p>

<h2>Market Failure</h2>

<ul>
<li>Monopoly</li>
<li>Externality: A benefit/negative from someone else buying or doing something</li>
<li>public goods: nonrival - ones use will not lessen someone else's use</li>
</ul>

<p>Gov regulation</p>

<h2>The market for innovation: How much innovation is optimal for society</h2>

<p>Innovation has externalities so the social demand is actually higher than the
firm(s) private demand. </p>

<pre><code>S_p &lt; S_s

D_p &lt; D_s

Q_p &lt; Q_s
</code></pre>

<h2>Knowledge as a public good</h2>

<p>Not always the case because
- patents
- Secrecy
- holding back</p>

<p>non-rival good: the use of the good does not reduce the good's availability to
others.</p>

<p>it can be non-excludable too - "pure public good"</p>

<p>marginal cost approaches zero for public goods</p>

<h2>Innovation as a private good with positive externalities</h2>

<p>patents</p>

<pre><code>invent a bicycle chain -&gt; bicycle chain -&gt; patent -&gt; (part of) knowledge becomes
available.
</code></pre>

<p>spillovers: the firm cannot charge all the beneficiaries of its innovation</p>

<h2>Indivisiblities, uncertainty, and captial markets</h2>

<p>eg. google 
- search engine into cars, maps, phone, Google glass, TV, </p>

<p>Financiers
- venture capitalists
- banks</p>

<p>Incomplete knowledge
- hard for people to recognize potential</p>

<p>Governments are hesitant to collaboration 
- monopolistic </p>

<h2>Patent races and duplication</h2>

<h1>21 - 01 - 2013</h1>

<h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>

<p>The length of a patent is very general. Ideally it should be long enough for the
investing company to make back their costs plus a little bit for profit.</p>

<p>Trade marks are important for building reputation and not having another company
use your reputation.</p>

<p>Copyright mainly entertains written media although other media such as music may
also be covered.</p>

<h2>Patents</h2>
