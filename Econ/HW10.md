"International financial flows can only hinder economic growth." Discuss
-----

There are two main types for international financial flows.  One is foreign
direct investment and the other is portfolio investment.  The key difference
between the two is that foreign direct investment (FDI) consists of investment,
technology and management whereas portfolio investment consists of bonds or
shares. In addition, FDI is more of a long term investment than portfolio
investment.  

There are many effects from FDI and although the exact effect depends on the
characteristics of the economy, Greenhalgh lists them as:

> effects of inward FDI include a direct positive impact on GDP, increased tax
> revenues, increased exports, increased competition on domestic firms,
> technology spillovers to domestic firms, and forward and backward linkages to
> domestic firms...

To discuss the net impact further, of these effects the possible negative
effects are those impacting domestic firms. From a short-term perspective, the
competition from domestic firms could cause a loss of jobs and a decrease on
GDP.  However, over the long run GDP, domestic economy growth and overall social
welfare could increase do to spillovers, increased competition and tax income.
Greenhalgh mentions that overall there is a net benefit from FDI.

On the other hand portfolio investments are trickier to gauge their effect.  On
one hand it allows investors to pick out the most innovative firms and supply
them with increased income.  However, in practice, 

### Portfolio Investment
Cash and freely flow out and in.

In theory it is good because it allows investors to pursue investments with the
best return and gives the most innovative firms the most money.  

However it could also increase instability in a market (exchanges rates and
interest rates).

### Venture Capital (a subset of FDI)
Requires close work with the receiving firm for monitoring and expertise.


Under what circumstances might the TRIPS agreement damage welfare in poorer countries?
