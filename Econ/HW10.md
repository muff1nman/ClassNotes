### FDI
FDI is meant to be used to create new producing capacity and in turn increase
economic growth. FDI also comes with the knowledge to use the investment to
create this capacity which may affect economic growth in a good way. This is
especially important if the knowledge is tacit knowledge.

> The possible effects of inward FDI include a direct positive impact on GDP,
> increased tax revenues, increased exports, increased competition on domestic
> firms, technology spillovers to domestic firms, and forward and backward
> linkages to domestic firms.

The actual effects vary depending on factors such as level of education and
trade openness.  

> There is a general presumption that FDI can have a net benefit.

Efficient firms use FDI.

### Portfolio Investment
Cash and freely flow out and in.

In theory it is good because it allows investors to pursue investments with the
best return and gives the most innovative firms the most money.  

However it could also increase instability in a market (exchanges rates and
interest rates).

### Venture Capital (a subset of FDI)
Requires close work with the receiving firm for monitoring and expertise.
