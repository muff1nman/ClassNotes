### Innovation Surveys
1. asking firms about their activities
2. literature-based innovation output indicators (i.e. press releases, technical journals.)

### Assessing the Inputs to Innovation
1. Recorded level of R&D expenditures
	- Not all R&D leads to innovation
	- two faces of R&D (leaders and followers)
2. Highly skilled workers

### Measuring "Outputs" from Innovation
1. IPR (specifically patents and trademarks)

### The Use of an Innovation Index
Combine all the good stuff together into a single number!

US > Japan > EU

### Workers in R&D
Usually less as a percent because more gdp is spent for the higher waged skilled people
