Can the "Luddite view" be justified?
-------

The Luddite view is that the introduction of new technology will negatively
effect jobs especially in the case of capital equipment.

Usually it is seen as a misconception because employers don't keep a constant
output with fewer workers but instaead expand their output from a given
workforce.

The driving factor behind whether or not a worker will keep a job is based on if
their skills are made redundant by new technology.

The idea is that the input factor has become more efficient so more of it will
be used combination with other inputs if it can be substituted in for other
inputs. However, if it cannot be substituted, less of it will be used. 

when the output becomes cheaper there will be greater demand for the product
which increases the amount of jobs.

The above may not be the case, because it assumes that there is infinite demand
