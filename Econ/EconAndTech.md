Course Topics
----

- Determinants -- such as education, people,
- Consequences
- Market Failure -- electric cars? flying cars?

Key Questions
  What drives innovation?
  How does intellectual property influence innovation?
  Which economic systems and market structures yield more or better innovations?
  Does innovation replace jobs and lead to higher unemployment?
  What role does innovation play in the wealth or poverty of a nation?
  Is economic regulation good or bad for innovation?

What is the 'economics of innovation'?
  Microeconomics - understanding processes including how incentives affect firms

  Marcroeconomics - 'innovation' drives economic growth.. and economic growth
  drives living standards, environmental and political ...

  Economic Policy - ar there market failures in the innovation process and what
  if anything should the government do?

  Business Strategy - this is not a course on advisin firms how to innovate, but
  does include some insigh into this.

Invention and innovation
  What do we mean by invention and innovation?
    invention - the advent of new knowledge - creation of an idea to do or make
    something ( profitablility not yet verified )

    innovation - the implementation of that invention in the market.  Really
    bringing it out to the world - new product / process commercially valuable,
    i.e. successfully developed inventions.

    Example - apple didn't invent the tablet but did bring it successfully to
    market

Definition of Innovation
  Basic Def
    Introduction of new ideas that add 'value' to a firm's activities
  OECD the Oslo Manual
    - Introduction of a new product or a qualitative change in an existing product
    - process innovation new to an industry
    - the opening of a new market
    - development of new sources of supply for raw materials or other inputs
    - changes in industrial organization


  Business ahs only two functions, innovation and marketing. -- Peter F. Drucker

## Role of technology

- What does new technology contribute to the economy?
    Improves _prductivity_ leading to...
        economic growth which means...
            increased social welfare (standard of living)

- Productivity: output produced per unit of input

    E.g. labor productiviey

- How have you seen technology incorporated into economic models previously?


## Production Function

- Starting point for developing a supply curve for supply and demand model
- Simple Cobb-Douglas prduction function //Missing Stuff

## What do we see in the real world?

Technology constant 'A' improves over time

//Missing graph

Increase in A shifts q to the left and down

## What is 'A'

- *A = Exogenous* technological progress (innovation)
- In econ, technology is generally treated as an exogenous var (especially in
  the past )
- What does this mean?
    - We don't know why productivity increases 

## Why is productivty increasing over time?

Black Box !

## Microeconomics review

// Missing graph

x axis -- quanity
y axis -- price
increasing sloped line -- supply
decreasing sloped line -- demand

- Can you label all the parts?
- What does efficiency mean in this model?
    - Supply and demand are equal 
    - Nothing is wasted
    - Right in the middle
- What does equity mean in this model?
    - How fair things are?
    - Usually not included in economic models
    - Usually efficiency leads to equity
- Assuming perfect competition, where will the market end up?
    - Right in the middle
- What is teh invisible hand?
    - Drives the market to equilibrium
    - Adam Smith

Other
- Demand curve slopes down
    - Diminshing margin  //Missing Stuff
- Demand curve flat
    - No matter the price demand is the same
    - Competition -> Market price determines price
- Supply curve slopes up

## Adam Smith

- Invisible Hand
    - Markets tend to equilibrium on their own accord
> he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led
> by an *invisible hand* to promote an end which was no part of his intention..
> By pursuing his own interest he freqe //Missing stuff

## Invisible Hand

Note that the eqil. that the market tend to move to _does not_ nec. have to be
an equil. where social wlefare is maxed.
//Missing Stuff

## Economic Models

*Always Ask*:
- What are the assumptions of the model?
- How might the model perform if the assumptions are changed?

## Perfectly competive market model

*Assumptions of Perfect Competition*

- No barriers to entry: Equal access to inputs and technology (i.e. patents)
- Identical goods
- Perfect information: All market participants know prices (input prices, output
  prices, etc.
- Many buyers and sellers
- No uncertainty 
- Firms are price takers (its actions cannot impact market price)
- Transactions are costless

*Do all of these assumptions hold for high technology goods and services*

## Assignments

14 - 01 - 2013 | Lecture 3 | Market Structure Review
======

## Market Structure

####Perfect competition
- commodities

####Oligopoly ( Most markets )
- Microsoft

products are similar but still different

less sloped demand curve

####Monopoly 
- Exxcel? 
- Utilities (localized)? 
- PostalService 
- Military

####Natural Monopoly
- Utilities:  makes sense to have one firm in charge
- Gravel Pit (localized again)

###barriers to entry:
- captial
- reputation
- legislative
- patents
- economies of scale (walmart)

###barriers to exit:
- cost to exit (mining companies)
- sunk cost
    - these costs have to be taken care of before any money is made, in advance

## What types of firm innovates

### Perfectly Competitive firms?
#### No incentive

### Stable Monopoly (natual or legislated)?
#### Little incentive
#### Some Research with their extra profits

### Oligopolistic firms
#### Fertile ground for innovation!


16 - 01 - 2013 | Lecture 4 | The Market for Innovation
======

The growth miracle of free-enterprise?
---

Stock market crash - loans to people who could not afford - sell the loans
(which were overpriced)

Market Failure
-----

- Monopoly
- Externality: A benefit/negative from someone else buying or doing something
- public goods: nonrival - ones use will not lessen someone else's use

Gov regulation

The market for innovation: How much innovation is optimal for society
-----

Innovation has externalities so the social demand is actually higher than the
firm(s) private demand. 

    S_p < S_s

    D_p < D_s

    Q_p < Q_s

Knowledge as a public good
-----

Not always the case because
- patents
- Secrecy
- holding back

non-rival good: the use of the good does not reduce the good's availability to
others.

it can be non-excludable too - "pure public good"

marginal cost approaches zero for public goods

Innovation as a private good with positive externalities
-----

patents

    invent a bicycle chain -> bicycle chain -> patent -> (part of) knowledge becomes
    available. 

spillovers: the firm cannot charge all the beneficiaries of its innovation

Indivisibilities, uncertainty, and capital markets
-----

eg. Google 
- search engine into cars, maps, phone, Google glass, TV, 

Financiers
- venture capitalists
- banks

Incomplete knowledge
- hard for people to recognize potential

Governments are hesitant to collaboration 
- monopolistic 

Patent races and duplication
----


21 - 01 - 2013 | Lecture 5 | Patents and Innovation
======

Intellectual Property Rights
---

The length of a patent is very general. Ideally it should be long enough for the
investing company to make back their costs plus a little bit for profit.

Trade marks are important for building reputation and not having another company
use your reputation.

Copyright mainly entertains written media although other media such as music may
also be covered.

Patents
----

Novelty - 'newness'
Non-obviousness - you can't patent something that is stupidly obvious
Suitability for industrial application - commercial value

As patent law gets too strong, there is very little return to society.  Also
more lawsuits as a result leads to inefficiency ( time and capital ) 

USA has pretty strong patent law

Filing a patent takes around a year or so

#### Disclosure carries spillover risk for the filing firm
alternatives:
- trade secret
- rely on lead time, first to market

####Strategic patenting
Makes it hard for smaller firms to compete with the larger firms

#### Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA)
People across the world can invent things at the same time -> hard for courts to
manage who invent first

Encourages firms to patent trade secrets otherwise someone else might file
first.

23 - 01 - 2013 | Lecture 6 | Trademarks and Trade Secrets
======

Trademarks
---

Trade Secrets
-----
sometimes when selling a business, you agree to a non-compete agreement so that
you can't steal customers.

Trade Secret and the Law
----

Trade Secret vs Patent
----

Limitations of Trade Secret Law
-----

New slides
====

Copyright Law
-----

Patent and Copyright
----

Fair-Use
-----

Copyright term
----
Disney

PV perpetuity = 1 / r
limited copyright PV = (1-e^(-rt))/r
*See slides*

Increasing the copyright term does not have a significant effect on the creation
of new works.

Drawbacks to long copyright term
----
- transaction costs increase
    - find the copyright holder
    - raises cost to produce new codes
    - longer terms lead to rent-seeking (copyright trolls)

- intellectual public domain is a source of vital inputs into intellectual
  property

- Asymmetry between the owners and users
    - owners have a large stake to extend rights
    - users  have a small stake
    - owners lobby for copyright laws to be extended

Digital Media
-----

Since there is minimal price for a product, should focus on economies of scale.

28 - 01 - 2013 | Lecture 7 | The Entrepreneur, The Rule of Law and Innovation
======
*Note no slides for this week.  See the reading on blackboard*

Significance of the Entrepreneur
----
Entrepreneur = Independent Innovator
- risky
- extreme? 
- thinks of ideas that are 'crazy'

Incentives
-----
They make it less risky to innovate!

Entrepreneurial Rent-Seeking
-----

History
-----
Rome -> Violence
Medieval China -> corruption
Servile England -> taxation

Barriers to Classical innovation
-----
- people stay in their class brackets

30 - 01 - 2013
====

Ancient Rome
-----
If you were seen as a trader, you were not seen in good light.

Ancient China
----

Monasteries in the Middle Ages
---

Institutional change in the Middle Ages
-----

Servile Europe
----

What Changed?
----

Growth and Knowledge
----

The Epistemic Base
----
There is a basic level of understanding requirement before you can move on


The first industrial revolution
---


Side note
-----
water was poor up to the industrial rev.  So they drank wine instead.  Coffee
started to appear in england.  So they went from having a depressant to
stimulant... promoting growth.


The Second industrial Revolution
---

Aspirin (trial and error) vs Electricity (science)

A third revolution?
---
Very large pension funds were used to fund businesses past the startup stage.

Its hard to tell if the IT "revolution" is a true revolution and it will take
time to tell as we are living in it right now

04 - 02 - 2013 | Lecture 8 | Creative Destruction
====

Communism
---
#####Karl Marx
Not from Russia, from Germany.
Capitalism feeds off of building stuff like in wars. 
Lenin got some ideas from Karl Marx.

His ideas were based off of industrialized countries such as UK and USA, not
Agricultural countries like China or Russia.

#####Mao Zedong

Marxian Economics
----

Schumpeter says that Marxian Econ is appealing in that he has all the
answers.

Marx is the first economist who says capitalism is great for producing stuff...
Growth!  But he said it will end with collapse.

Joseph Schumpeter
-----
He started the idea that creative destruction is the old companies being
replaced with the new.

The "Problem" of Monopoly
---

What's the Problem?
----
Study of Economics is all over the place
we need dynamic models

Dynamic vs Static Optimization
---
Applies to our Economy

Capitalism's Evolutionary Character
-----
Capitalism is constantly changing, not static

The Fundamental Impulse
----

Creative Destruction  (CD)
----
Not a policy but a way of looking at the market, the world.

CD and Economics
---
Don't be so concerned about monopolies, be more concerned with the forces that
lead to the creation and destruction of firms.

Larry the Liquidator
--
Creative Destruction

Stock price doesn't necessarily reflect the value of a firm.

one of the big problems with CD is people losing jobs and not being able to move
on.

The Discipline of CD
---

Economies and Economics
----
A way of *thinking* about the market.

The Creative Class
---

Opposition to Creative Destruction
--
Governments can promote or scale back creative destruction and innovation

Additional points
1. Discourages people from doing the risky and creative thing
2. Good products existing may get replaced. 
3. Hard to know how long its gonna take to pay back.
4. Hard to do, abstract. 
5. Countries cannot really catch up


06 - 02 - 2013 | Lecture 9 | Capitalism and Innovation
====

The Miracle of Capitalism
---
People were still working in agriculture so it took a while for the first
industrial revolution to spill over.

Steel (mass production) marked the beginning of the 2nd industrial revolution.

Population growth helped supply growth.  Also was fueled by agriculture,
medicine, etc.

Why has capitalism been relatively...
---
1. 
2. Engineers are expected to improve technologies
3. 
4. Property rights - Magna Carta
5. Market

The Substantial but _Imperfect_ growth Efficiency of Capitalism
---
Supply and demand leads to efficiency

Not efficient in the growth process

Less investment because of spill overs. -> less innovation

spillovers cause additional growth (new technology)

Incorporating Growth Analysis..
---
- Hedging
    - Less risk, spread risk out over multiple innovations/inventions
    - Less profit

The Growth Promoting Attributes of Capitalism
---
Invention happened in many other types of economies
But Capitalism helps the transition from invention to innovation

Capitalist Growth
----

Routine vs Independent Innovators
---

Inefficiency of Capitalist Growth
---

Inefficiency of Capitalist Growth
---
1. 
2. Older assets dry up
3. 
4. Stunts growth
5. 
6. 

Voluntary dissemination

11 - 02 - 2013 | Lecture 10 | Oligopoly and Investment Risk
======

Oligopoly and R&D
----
Increasing returns of scale lead to more efficient output as they get larger.

e.g. Walmart bullies the suppliers by telling them what price they would like.

Oligopolies are hard to model, so economists tend to focus on perfect
competition.

Innovation is Risky
-----
- diversifying
    - different markets, products and inventions
- Collaboration
    - share efforts for basic research

Innovation Kitchen Nike

13 - 02 - 2013 | Lecture 11 | Oligopoly and Routinization of Innovation
======

Risk Aversion
-----
Executive making the decision can risk making lots of money for losing their
job.

Oligopolistic Innovation
-----

Pressure to Routinize Innovation
-----

Corporate approach to routinization
---
More money -> more risky bets
More money -> larger -> slow response to new technologies

Relevance of Sunk Costs
-----
Creates a barrier to entry


20 - 02 - 2013 | Lecture 12 | Firm Size and Contestable Markets
======

Sunk Costs And Non-Zero Profits for Oligopolies
---
Oligopolies have high returns (~20%) because they have market power and because
of the risk premium.

When can profits still be greater than 0:
//skip

Strategic Counter-measures:
- lower prices (I.E. Starbucks)
- Lobby the government for laws in their benefit

R&D Arms Races within Oligopoly
----
Short term decrease in R&D allows for high profits but in the long term you will go out of
business

If one business increases their R&D then other businesses will have to increase
as well.

It benefits society for businesses to increase R&D spending.

Arms-Race Model Conclusions:
----

Technical Change and GDP
---

// New slides

The importance of market power
----

The importance of absolute size
-----
One caveat is that large firms have higher overhead, bureaucracy and are slower

Small firms can have market power. I.E. instagram had a valuable customer base
that scared Facebook.

Industrial Organization
---

Contestable Markets Model
----

Repeated sinking of funds is not a barrier to entry but rather a catalyst for
kicking firms out that don't innovate

3. is a crucial idea - firms are going to be as big as the marginal profits
   provide - most efficient

Higher Prices
---

25 - 02 - 2013
=========

Review
-----
Contestable market      Perfect Competition
--------------------------------------------
Many or few Firms       Large number of firms

Economies of Scale      No economies of scale

No Barriers             None
to entry or exit

In contestable markets there are some small firms that can take a segment of the
market away from big firms. 

Side Note
----
New York draws people from all over the world to start a career, make a
business, etc.

If you are not good, you're not gonna make it

Contestable Markets
------

Higher Prices
---------
Because of R&D

Discriminatory Prices
-----

Frequency of Entry
----

Why enter such a market?
--------

Market Concentration
----
high concentration means a couple firms have a lot of market share
On its own is not a great indication

Conclusions
-------

27 - 02 - 2013 | Lecture 13 | Dissemination of Technology and Collaboration
=======

Collaboration between innovative firms
------

Patent issues make it required

Consortiums decrease licensing costs

Why must firms collaborate or die?
-----
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Time is important

Four Types of R&D Collaboration
-----
1. Patent Consortiums, standards adoption
2. 
3. Feedback,  really the same thing as 2
4. Chapter 4 in the book, universities holding patents, universities consulting

Foxconn, provides spillover to other firms sourcing with them

The larger the R&D firm the more likely for collaboration
    - more budget
    - combine with firms of similar size
    - small firm doesn't have as much patents
    - small firm has more risk
    - large firm can steal the small firm technology, and litigate/crush small
      firms

Innovation and dissemination
------
conflict --- you want profits, so you may want patents which goes against
dissemination

Empirical evidence
------
Competitve entry, time it takes for someone else to come up with a similar
product to compete with the original work

Incentives for voluntary dissemination
------
### Technology license markets
1. patents are scarce
2. 

Firms will choose option in their best interest

Technology licensing
------
Common to license and still make a profit

The complex networks do the most efficient allocation for each node

### Why don't firms copy technology?

Captures spillovers, (negative externality?)

04 - 03 - 2013 | Lecture 14 | The Technology Consortium Model
=======

Benefits of technology consortia
-----
Repetition makes possibility of screwing your neighbor less. (Game theory)

Technology Consortia in Practice
------

Why join?
------

The Technology Consortium Model
-----

1. Each innovation is slightly different, but complementary, important for the
   model to work
2.
3.
4.

####Model Params
Variable costs

    x: expenditure on R&D
    n: number of participating firms
    r: expected return for R&D 
    s: cost reduction from other participants
    C(yP): Cost of producing y units for the participating firms
    C(yH): Cost of producing y units for the hold out firm

    TC = VC + TC
    TC = C(y) + x 

    Participants 1…n: TC = C(yP)[1-r-s(n-1)] + x
    Hold out firm:    TC = C(yH)[1-r] + x

    For the next term:

    Participants 1…n: TC = C(yP)[1-r-s(n-1)]^2 + x
    Hold out firm:    TC = C(yH)[1-r]^2 + x


Perfect competition model, so straight across Demand curve

*Know* that the firms participating are more profitable

Compounding effect between the difference in the hold out firm and the consortium
costs.

Welfare Gains from Consortium
------

18 - 03 - 2013 | Networks | Lecture 15
=====

Network Effects
-----
key: demand-side economies of scale

Economies of Scale
------
Supply-side economies of scale vs Demand-side economies of scale.
supply-side example: mining operation
demand-side example: instagram, facebook

Adoption and Critical Mass
-----
Slow progress during launch
increasing rate during takeoff
slow down during saturation when there are no more users

winner-take-all market <code>-></code> <em>tippy</em> market

Tippy Markets
-----

The Tipping Point
----

Modeling the Rate of Adoption of Innovation
-----
(From the Reading this week)

- people tell others about great products and there is a possibility the other
  will use it too

- early adopters - offer at a low price to entice these people to try your
  product - called the bargain and ripoff strategy
- 

Economic Model of Diffusion
------
wasn't paying attention

How the Characteristics (index z) Determine the Rate of Adoption
----

Product Differentiation
----

A tipping point example
----

Metcalfe's Law
---------

Lock In
-------
Gives market power over their customers
i.e. photoshop -> don't want to learn gimp

    branch selection -> sampling -> entrenchment (learning) -> lock-in

the original supplier can extract that additional switching cost by charging
more

once the choice is made -> supplier is a monopolist
before the choice is made -> there is competition

Lock-in and Customers
-----
Companies may rely on people not having the time to switch


Collective Switching Costs
-----
must get everyone to switch -- nearly impossible

How Firms Develop Critical Mass
----

Social Welfare Implications
------
incompatibility can harm competition - windows vs linux?


20 - 03 - 2013 | Lecture 16 | Innovation Incentives and Spillovers
=======

Optimal Spillover Model
------
Green curve shifts left because firm gains from its own spillovers
red curve shifts down because costs go down

How would a change in the spillover ratio...
-----
Workers spillover benefits eventually go down because they won't have a job

More Questions on Spillover Ratio
-----
happier workers with more spillover
no workers at a spillover of 1

"n" is the best spot
although m thro v is good too.
closer to m benefits investors
closer to n benefits the workers more
The US is about 80% ~ pretty high
With no intellectual property rights it would be closer to 1.
To adjust the USA?
- Strengthen IPR's if the USA is too high?
- Lower cost, subsidize R&D 

Other countries have different spillover ratios

Not really much to talk about on no 5.

Spillover & CD
-----------
What is a drawback of too much creative destruction  (EXAM Q)
- uncertainty?
- did not understand

Creative Destruction vs Spillovers
------
Spillovers calm some things down and are a disincentive to investment

Policy Implications
-----

25 - 03 - 2013 | Innovation and Economic Growth | Lecture 17
======

Economic Growth
-----
economic growth is increases in social welfare or standard of living.

1. Can economic growth be sustained in the long run?

2. What determines long run growth?

Exogenous - technology is outside the model

Its like putting the engine from the ferrari in a voltswagon.  ~ in reference to
too much growth

The Very Long Run
-----
Why aren't the non-oecd countries growing?

USA, UK, and Ireland
----

China and India
-----

Brazil, S. Korea, Philippines
---
Brazil is now taking off.

GDP per capita growth not everything
-----
Venezula ~ natural resources reserves ~ the wealth goes to the top people and
the rest are not getting anything

Neoclassical Growth Theory
----
Diminishing returns to capital
- start with three people and two shovels: adding a shovel is good
- start with three people and three shovels: adding a shovel does not benefit
  much

When there is a lot of labor, and little capital, additional capital helps

Saved capital is used to purchase more capital

When additional capital does not help the economy becomes steady without growth

The model cannot explain technical change or growth thereof

Production function
- output on the left hand side, on the right hand side you have the function on
  inputs

Capital accumulation equation
- accumulate capital and depreciation

Solow-Swan equations
----

Cobb-Douglas - diminishing returns to capital and labor

GDP per worker and k
------

Accumulation equation
-----
Tend to where the steady state is or <code>delta*k = s*y</code>

Solow-Swan equil
----

What happens if savings increase?
----

What if labour force grows?
----
it has a dilution effect, it has a negative effect on capital

Golden Rule
----

Over saving
-----

Solow's Surprise
----

What if technology grows?
------

Graphically
-----
it shifts to the right because the ratio of capital to labour becomes unstable. 

Innovation process
-----

    research -> investment


Summary of Solow-Swan
-----
everyone converges if there is no growth in technology

27 - 03 - 2013 | Endogenous Economic Growth Models | Lecture 18
=======

Endogenous growth models
-----
Endogenous model -- "this stuff get hairy real quickly"

it shows that capital investment is important (he accidentally wrote it in double
negatives)

The AK model
----
not completely practical because it is too simple

The AK model in a diagram
----
increase in savings ratio -- flip investment growth line up -- increase the long
run growth rate (not just a leveling effect)

Endogenous technology growth
-----
K now includes all forms of capital (i.e. human capital, natural resources)


The problem also means that all firms resemble oligopolies

The production function encompasses external spillovers, the firm does not have
the same production function.

Knowledge Externalities
------

labour can be used to produce output or technology (done by research)

Romer model
-----

Larger countries with higher populations are going to have higher growth
(debatable?)


Human capital - the Lucas model
----

Creative destruction and firm-level activity
----
gone over before

Market failures in R&D growth models
------

What do we learn from such models?
------
*its the increase in knowledge from spillovers that are driving growth*

- ahistorical 
    - they don't look at historical data

Competition and Growth
-----
Competition is a good thing for consumers but too much competition is not good
because then there are no profits to hold over and to use for R&D

contestable markets: the right number of firms to match market demand in the
most efficient way

Do scale effects exist?
------
the knowledge spillovers are important

01 - 04 - 2013 | Venture Capital | Lecture 19
=====

start-up companies
-----
If there is asymmetric information banks and investors will not want to invest
because they don't have the same level of knowledge

Financing Young Firms
------

The Role of Venture Capital
-----
agency problem - the money is wasted by managers because there is no control of
the money

why is it 3 to 10 years?
- the fund closes after a certain time

What are VCs?
-----
Pension funds are the typical investors for VC funds

The general partners organize the fund and have to give to the venture capital
fund as well.

Limited partnership makes sure there is limited liability.

How VCs Operate
----
Too early in the S curve is not good because VCs want to focus on growth

Historical Investment in VC
------
Ronald Regan allowed pension funds to invest in VC.

Historical Returns to Investment from VC
------

Geographical Spread of VC Investment
-----
Investment is usually very local.

Venture Capital Cycle
----
1. Raise Funds
    - people with a network persuades people to invest
2. Invest Funds in Firms
    - select firms
3. Monitor Firms and Add Value
    - agency problem mitigated?
4. Sell Firms, Close Fund, Return Investment and return to #1.
    - IPO, sell firms

Fund raising
-----
Pension funds want the greediest people to manage the fund so that they ensure
the fund does well.

Monitoring
----
1.
2. Reduces risk

Exiting Venture Capital Investment
-------

03 - 04 - 2013 | Venture Capital, Innovation and Growth | Lecture 20
==========

Venture Capital and Growth
---------

The Cyclical nature of VC
----
Capital is tied up in firms and is not elastic and so has a vertical supply bar.


Why is VC sticky?
------
cash is tied up more than stock

established VC firms: with more money, comes poorer quality firms, and returns dip

New VC firms are slow to enter the market because a lack of experience and
networking

#### Information Lags
ex. the value [of a company] is first based on the assets such as buildings, which
is much lower than the value the stock market may value it at. (underinvestment)


Why does VC Overreact?
-------

Consequences for Innovation
------
VC needs people who understand the industry.

There is pressure on the partners

Policy and VC
-------
Government should step in when VC funding is weak.

08 - 04 - 2013 | Innovation and Globalization | Lecture 21
========

What is globalization?
-------
Tying economies together.

Openness of financial economies allow for funds to flow across countries.

World trade in historical perspective
-------
When the depressions happen, govts put tariffs in place which leads to trade
being limited across countries.

World Trade Organization (WTO) tries to limit countries tariffs.


Theories of trade and growth
-------
1. Theory of comparative advantage
    - New Zealand has a better chance of making apples and can make it cheaper
      than say Colorado.
2. Product Cycle Models
    - products go through a cycle and depending on where it is will be produced
      in other areas
3. Learning by doing models
4. Technology catch-up models
    - i.e. North Korea


Comparative Advantage
------

- HOS model
    - you don't see diminishing returns because output doesn't affect price

Both models are static.


Product Cycle Models
------
1. New product
    - requires skills and resources to develop the technology
2. Maturing product
3. Standardize product
    - not complex any more and can be mass produced.


Advanced countries still trade and dont completely specialize because there is a
demand for variety.


Learning by Doing models
-------
- tacit knowledge 
    - not easy to just reverse engineer, there is knowledge that isnt published.


Catch-up models
-------
poor countries need the capacity to absorb technology and R&D. 
i.e. samsung in South Korea.


Poorer countries : technological catch-up models
-------------


Implications of technological catch-up models
-------


Catching-up and Falling behind
------

What determines absorptive capability?
--------
1. Institutions
2. Accessibility
    - FDI (Foreign Direct Investment)
    - Proximity to other developed countries.
3. Ability to Learn
4. Incentives to implement new technologies
    - low tax rates
    - stable
    - property rights

International financial flows
------
encourages spillovers

government uses bonds to get capital.


Private capital flows ... from the book
------
the companies can fail when there is too much volatility in a countries capital
flow.

Foreign Direct Investment (Google)
-----
other companies follow
brings jobs for employees
spillovers

Google Ireland
-----
countries/govts have to compete very hard to get firms to come in.

Foreign Direct Investment
---------
1. 
2. some spillover into country
3. forces local firms to innovate or puts them out of business

Short Term financial flows
------
- positive
    - raising competition in financial markets - > decreases interest rate.
- negative
    - 

Trade Openness and growth
----

DCA - overtime comparative advantage can change in the long run.

International aspects of IPR
-----

Technology, wages and jobs | 17 - 04 - 2013 | Lecture 22
============

Does new technology destroy jobs?
--------
Low skilled workers may loose their jobs.

Luddites were high skilled and lost their jobs

fallacy - they can keep the workers and produce more.

Process Innovation
------

Reasons for the shift in demand
-----


Relative wages
-----


Globalization - Is international trade also skill based?
-----

predictive analysis

Product Personalization
----------
you can also price discriminate

it is bad for the consumer because they do not get as much surplus, but also
might benefit if the stores know that you are not willing to pay as much

studies show that price discrimination is good for the consumer over time

Customer Information
---------

Personalized Pricing
-----

Versioning Products
-------------
costs of production do not reflect costs of production for versions

stock market quotes are time dependent for value

newspapers might have localized content offline

Value-Subtraction
--------
Sometimes a user can turn it back on.

Goldilocks pricing
------
The big assumption of neoclassical econ is that people are rational. This may
not always be true. i.e. herd mentality of stock prices.

Behavioral Econ Example
--------
if you phrase the question in a different way (gains / losses) there will be
different results.

Back to Goldilocks Pricing
--------

========

IPRS and economic growth
------

impacts of patenting
------

complex relationships between iprs and growth
-------
you need laws - good institutions.

poor countries benefit because they are likely to attract FDI and they can't
make knock-offs.

middle countries could immitate and make knock-offs.

there is a negative effect in that it is hard for countries to get going without
coping which is prevented by iprs.

Historical studies - the swiss didn't have patent protection so industries
specialized in trade secrets like chocolate

WTO
----
WTO tries to help out poorer countries.

TRIPS
-------
It is harder to trade without being a member of WTO (tariffs)

established minimum ipr protection

### Impacts
- should increase ipr flow into the developed countries
- increase market power of innovating firms ( more monopoly like)
- however it may also increase market share
- so really it depends on the product

### technology transfer


01 - 05 - 2013  | Technology and Mineral Resources | Lecture 25
=====

Resource Scarcity
--------
most of the rare earth minerals come from china. (environmental costs)

Historical Perspective
--------

Economic Exhaustion
-----------
- Fixed Stock Paradigm
    - peak oil theory
        - peak production happens in '73 and then a decline.
        - prices went up, huge lines
        - the issue with the theory is that it doesn't take into account finding
          new oil
        - it was just a good guess
        - it assumes that price stays the same which is not the case.
        - consumers will find alternatives instead
- Opportunity Cost Paradigm
    - people start using other things when cost goes up

Mineral Supply
-----
- Ricardian Rent - cheaper to get it to market because the quality is higher.
- Hotelling Rent - You cant use a barrell in the future after you use it

Mineral Prices
------

The Resource Base
------
Reserves - scheduled to produce
Resources - potentially economic to produce
Resource Base - On the whole planet (Everything)

*As the price rising the potential resources become more attractive*

The biomodal - the hump on the right is the easily avaialable stuff, the one on
the left is the resource base

Discontinuity of Supply
-----

Long Run Supply
----

The price would drop if a large quanity of supply was brought back to the
market.

Demand
-----
Increasing population will affect demand a little bit.

Intensity of Use
------
A developed country will have a declined use of material as infrastructure
demands fall off.

Sustainability
-----

Technology and the Long run
-----
