Course Topics
----

- Determinants -- such as education, people,
- Consequences
- Market Failure -- electric cars? flying cars?

Key Questions
  What drives innovation?
  How does intellectual property influence innovation?
  Which economic systems and market structures yield more or better innovations?
  Does innovation replace jobs and lead to higher unemployment?
  What role does innovation play in the wealth or poverty of a nation?
  Is economic regulation good or bad for innovation?

What is the 'economics of innovation'?
  Microeconomics - understanding processes including how incentives affect firms

  Marcroeconomics - 'innovation' drives economic growth.. and economic growth
  drives living standards, environmental and political ...

  Economic Policy - ar there market failures in the innovation process and what
  if anything should the government do?

  Business Strategy - this is not a course on advisin firms how to innovate, but
  does include some insigh into this.

Invention and innovation
  What do we mean by invention and innovation?
    invention - the advent of new knowledge - creation of an idea to do or make
    something ( profitablility not yet verified )

    innovation - the implementation of that invention in the market.  Really
    bringing it out to the world - new product / process commercially valuable,
    i.e. successfully developed inventions.

    Example - apple didn't invent the tablet but did bring it successfully to
    market

Definition of Innovation
  Basic Def
    Introduction of new ideas that add 'value' to a firm's activities
  OECD the Oslo Manual
    - Introduction of a new product or a qualitative change in an existing product
    - process innovation new to an industry
    - the opening of a new market
    - development of new sources of supply for raw materials or other inputs
    - changes in industrial organization


  Business ahs only two functions, innovation and marketing. -- Peter F. Drucker

## Role of technology

- What does new technology contribute to the economy?
    Improves _prductivity_ leading to...
        economic growth which means...
            increased social welfare (standard of living)

- Productivity: output produced per unit of input

    E.g. labor productiviey

- How have you seen technology incorporated into economic models previously?


## Production Function

- Starting point for developing a supply curve for supply and demand model
- Simple Cobb-Douglas prduction function //Missing Stuff

## What do we see in the real world?

Technology constant 'A' improves over time

//Missing graph

Increase in A shifts q to the left and down

## What is 'A'

- *A = Exogenous* technological progress (innovation)
- In econ, technology is generally treated as an exogenous var (especially in
  the past )
- What does this mean?
    - We don't know why productivity increases 

## Why is productivty increasing over time?

Black Box !

## Microeconomics review

// Missing graph

x axis -- quanity
y axis -- price
increasing sloped line -- supply
decreasing sloped line -- demand

- Can you label all the parts?
- What does efficiency mean in this model?
    - Supply and demand are equal 
    - Nothing is wasted
    - Right in the middle
- What does equity mean in this model?
    - How fair things are?
    - Usually not included in economic models
    - Usually efficiency leads to equity
- Assuming perfect competition, where will the market end up?
    - Right in the middle
- What is teh invisible hand?
    - Drives the market to equilibrium
    - Adam Smith

Other
- Demand curve slopes down
    - Diminshing margin  //Missing Stuff
- Demand curve flat
    - No matter the price demand is the same
    - Competition -> Market price determines price
- Supply curve slopes up

## Adam Smith

- Invisible Hand
    - Markets tend to equilibrium on their own accord
> he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led
> by an *invisible hand* to promote an end which was no part of his intention..
> By pursuing his own interest he freqe //Missing stuff

## Invisible Hand

Note that the eqil. that the market tend to move to _does not_ nec. have to be
an equil. where social wlefare is maxed.
//Missing Stuff

## Economic Models

*Always Ask*:
- What are the assumptions of the model?
- How might the model perform if the assumptions are changed?

## Perfectly competive market model

*Assumptions of Perfect Competition*

- No barriers to entry: Equal access to inputs and technology (i.e. patents)
- Identical goods
- Perfect information: All market participants know prices (input prices, output
  prices, etc.
- Many buyers and sellers
- No uncertainty 
- Firms are price takers (its actions cannot impact market price)
- Transactions are costless

*Do all of these assumptions hold for high technology goods and services*

14 - 01 - 2013 | Lecture 3 | Market Structure Review
======

## Market Structure

####Perfect competition
- commodities

####Oligopoly ( Most markets )
- Microsoft

products are similar but still different

less sloped demand curve

####Monopoly 
- Exxcel? 
- Utilities (localized)? 
- PostalService 
- Military

####Natural Monopoly
- Utilities:  makes sense to have one firm in charge
- Gravel Pit (localized again)

###barriers to entry:
- captial
- reputation
- legislative
- patents
- economies of scale (walmart)

###barriers to exit:
- cost to exit (mining companies)
- sunk cost
    - these costs have to be taken care of before any money is made, in advance

## What types of firm innovates

### Perfectly Competitive firms?
#### No incentive

### Stable Monopoly (natual or legislated)?
#### Little incentive
#### Some Research with their extra profits

### Oligopolistic firms
#### Fertile ground for innovation!


16 - 01 - 2013 | Lecture 4 | The Market for Innovation
======

The growth miracle of free-enterprise?
---

Stock market crash - loans to people who could not afford - sell the loans
(which were overpriced)

Market Failure
-----

- Monopoly
- Externality: A benefit/negative from someone else buying or doing something
- public goods: nonrival - ones use will not lessen someone else's use

Gov regulation

The market for innovation: How much innovation is optimal for society
-----

Innovation has externalities so the social demand is actually higher than the
firm(s) private demand. 

    S_p < S_s

    D_p < D_s

    Q_p < Q_s

Knowledge as a public good
-----

Not always the case because
- patents
- Secrecy
- holding back

non-rival good: the use of the good does not reduce the good's availability to
others.

it can be non-excludable too - "pure public good"

marginal cost approaches zero for public goods

Innovation as a private good with positive externalities
-----

patents

    invent a bicycle chain -> bicycle chain -> patent -> (part of) knowledge becomes
    available. 

spillovers: the firm cannot charge all the beneficiaries of its innovation

Indivisibilities, uncertainty, and capital markets
-----

eg. Google 
- search engine into cars, maps, phone, Google glass, TV, 

Financiers
- venture capitalists
- banks

Incomplete knowledge
- hard for people to recognize potential

Governments are hesitant to collaboration 
- monopolistic 

Patent races and duplication
----


21 - 01 - 2013 | Lecture 5 | Patents and Innovation
======

Intellectual Property Rights
---

The length of a patent is very general. Ideally it should be long enough for the
investing company to make back their costs plus a little bit for profit.

Trade marks are important for building reputation and not having another company
use your reputation.

Copyright mainly entertains written media although other media such as music may
also be covered.

Patents
----

Novelty - 'newness'
Non-obviousness - you can't patent something that is stupidly obvious
Suitability for industrial application - commercial value

As patent law gets too strong, there is very little return to society.  Also
more lawsuits as a result leads to inefficiency ( time and capital ) 

USA has pretty strong patent law

Filing a patent takes around a year or so

#### Disclosure carries spillover risk for the filing firm
alternatives:
- trade secret
- rely on lead time, first to market

####Strategic patenting
Makes it hard for smaller firms to compete with the larger firms

#### Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA)
People across the world can invent things at the same time -> hard for courts to
manage who invent first

Encourages firms to patent trade secrets otherwise someone else might file
first.

23 - 01 - 2013 | Lecture 6 | Trademarks and Trade Secrets
======

Trademarks
---

Trade Secrets
-----
sometimes when selling a business, you agree to a non-compete agreement so that
you can't steal customers.

Trade Secret and the Law
----

Trade Secret vs Patent
----

Limitations of Trade Secret Law
-----

New slides
====

Copyright Law
-----

Patent and Copyright
----

Fair-Use
-----

Copyright term
----
Disney

PV perpetuity = 1 / r
limited copyright PV = (1-e^(-rt))/r
*See slides*

Increasing the copyright term does not have a significant effect on the creation
of new works.

Drawbacks to long copyright term
----
- transaction costs increase
    - find the copyright holder
    - raises cost to produce new codes
    - longer terms lead to rent-seeking (copyright trolls)

- intellectual public domain is a source of vital inputs into intellectual
  property

- Asymmetry between the owners and users
    - owners have a large stake to extend rights
    - users  have a small stake
    - owners lobby for copyright laws to be extended

Digital Media
-----

Since there is minimal price for a product, should focus on economies of scale.

28 - 01 - 2013 | Lecture 7 | The Entrepreneur, The Rule of Law and Innovation
======
*Note no slides for this week.  See the reading on blackboard*

Significance of the Entrepreneur
----
Entrepreneur = Independent Innovator
- risky
- extreme? 
- thinks of ideas that are 'crazy'

Incentives
-----
They make it less risky to innovate!

Entrepreneurial Rent-Seeking
-----

History
-----
Rome -> Violence
Medieval China -> corruption
Servile England -> taxation

Barriers to Classical innovation
-----
- people stay in their class brackets

30 - 01 - 2013
====

Ancient Rome
-----
If you were seen as a trader, you were not seen in good light.

Ancient China
----

Monasteries in the Middle Ages
---

Institutional change in the Middle Ages
-----

Servile Europe
----

What Changed?
----

Growth and Knowledge
----

The Epistemic Base
----
There is a basic level of understanding requirement before you can move on


The first industrial revolution
---


Side note
-----
water was poor up to the industrial rev.  So they drank wine instead.  Coffee
started to appear in england.  So they went from having a depressant to
stimulant... promoting growth.


The Second industrial Revolution
---

Aspirin (trial and error) vs Electricity (science)

A third revolution?
---
Very large pension funds were used to fund businesses past the startup stage.

Its hard to tell if the IT "revolution" is a true revolution and it will take
time to tell as we are living in it right now

04 - 02 - 2013 | Lecture 8 | Creative Destruction
====

Communism
---
#####Karl Marx
Not from Russia, from Germany.
Capitalism feeds off of building stuff like in wars. 
Lenin got some ideas from Karl Marx.

His ideas were based off of industrialized countries such as UK and USA, not
Agricultural countries like China or Russia.

#####Mao Zedong

Marxian Economics
----

Schumpeter says that Marxian Econ is appealing in that he has all the
answers.

Marx is the first economist who says capitalism is great for producing stuff...
Growth!  But he said it will end with collapse.

Joseph Schumpeter
-----
He started the idea that creative destruction is the old companies being
replaced with the new.

The "Problem" of Monopoly
---

What's the Problem?
----
Study of Economics is all over the place
we need dynamic models

Dynamic vs Static Optimization
---
Applies to our Economy

Capitalism's Evolutionary Character
-----
Capitalism is constantly changing, not static

The Fundamental Impulse
----

Creative Destruction  (CD)
----
Not a policy but a way of looking at the market, the world.

CD and Economics
---
Don't be so concerned about monopolies, be more concerned with the forces that
lead to the creation and destruction of firms.

Larry the Liquidator
--
Creative Destruction

Stock price doesn't necessarily reflect the value of a firm.

one of the big problems with CD is people losing jobs and not being able to move
on.

The Discipline of CD
---

Economies and Economics
----
A way of *thinking* about the market.

The Creative Class
---

Opposition to Creative Destruction
--
Governments can promote or scale back creative destruction and innovation

Additional points
1. Discourages people from doing the risky and creative thing
2. Good products existing may get replaced. 
3. Hard to know how long its gonna take to pay back.
4. Hard to do, abstract. 
5. Countries cannot really catch up


06 - 02 - 2013 | Lecture 9 | Capitalism and Innovation
====

The Miracle of Capitalism
---
People were still working in agriculture so it took a while for the first
industrial revolution to spill over.

Steel (mass production) marked the beginning of the 2nd industrial revolution.

Population growth helped supply growth.  Also was fueled by agriculture,
medicine, etc.

Why has capitalism been relatively...
---
1. 
2. Engineers are expected to improve technologies
3. 
4. Property rights - Magna Carta
5. Market

The Substantial but _Imperfect_ growth Efficiency of Capitalism
---
Supply and demand leads to efficiency

Not efficient in the growth process

Less investment because of spill overs. -> less innovation

spillovers cause additional growth (new technology)

Incorporating Growth Analysis..
---
- Hedging
    - Less risk, spread risk out over multiple innovations/inventions
    - Less profit

The Growth Promoting Attributes of Capitalism
---
Invention happened in many other types of economies
But Capitalism helps the transition from invention to innovation

Capitalist Growth
----

Routine vs Independent Innovators
---

Inefficiency of Capitalist Growth
---

Inefficiency of Capitalist Growth
---
1. 
2. Older assets dry up
3. 
4. Stunts growth
5. 
6. 

Voluntary dissemination

11 - 02 - 2013 | Lecture 10 | Oligopoly and Investment Risk
======

Oligopoly and R&D
----
Increasing returns of scale lead to more efficient output as they get larger.

e.g. Walmart bullies the suppliers by telling them what price they would like.

Oligopolies are hard to model, so economists tend to focus on perfect
competition.

Innovation is Risky
-----
- diversifying
    - different markets, products and inventions
- Collaboration
    - share efforts for basic research

Innovation Kitchen Nike

13 - 02 - 2013 | Lecture 11 | Oligopoly and Routinization of Innovation
======

Risk Aversion
-----
Executive making the decision can risk making lots of money for losing their
job.

Oligopolistic Innovation
-----

Pressure to Routinize Innovation
-----

Corporate approach to routinization
---
More money -> more risky bets
More money -> larger -> slow response to new technologies

Relevance of Sunk Costs
-----
Creates a barrier to entry


20 - 02 - 2013 | Lecture 12 | Firm Size and Contestable Markets
======

Sunk Costs And Non-Zero Profits for Oligopolies
---
Oligopolies have high returns (~20%) because they have market power and because
of the risk premium.

When can profits still be greater than 0:
//skip

Strategic Counter-measures:
- lower prices (I.E. Starbucks)
- Lobby the government for laws in their benefit

R&D Arms Races within Oligopoly
----
Short term decrease in R&D allows for high profits but in the long term you will go out of
business

If one business increases their R&D then other businesses will have to increase
as well.

It benefits society for businesses to increase R&D spending.

Arms-Race Model Conclusions:
----

Technical Change and GDP
---

// New slides

The importance of market power
----

The importance of absolute size
-----
One caveat is that large firms have higher overhead, bureaucracy and are slower

Small firms can have market power. I.E. instagram had a valuable customer base
that scared Facebook.

Industrial Organization
---

Contestable Markets Model
----

Repeated sinking of funds is not a barrier to entry but rather a catalyst for
kicking firms out that don't innovate

3. is a crucial idea - firms are going to be as big as the marginal profits
   provide - most efficient

Higher Prices
---

Review
-----
Contestable market      Perfect Competition
--------------------------------------------
Many or few Firms       Large number of firms

Economies of Scale      No economies of scale

No Barriers             None
to entry or exit

In contestable markets there are some small firms that can take a segment of the
market away from big firms. 

Side Note
----
New York draws people from all over the world to start a career, make a
business, etc.

If you are not good, you're not gonna make it

Contestable Markets
------

Higher Prices
---------
Because of R&D

Discriminatory Prices
-----

Frequency of Entry
----

Why enter such a market?
--------

Market Concentration
----
high concentration means a couple firms have a lot of market share
On its own is not a great indication

Review Questions - Economic Models
-------
- Traditionally, how has tech been treated in economic models?
- How do market structure models differ?
    - Perfect Competition
        - No barriers to entry: Equal access to inputs and technology (i.e. patents)
        - Identical goods
        - Perfect information: All market participants know prices (input prices, output
          prices, etc.
        - Many buyers and sellers
        - No uncertainty 
        - Firms are price takers (its actions cannot impact market price)
            - Horizontal demand curve
        - MC = MR = Price, therefore profit = 0
        - Transactions are costless
        - Efficient outcome
    - Oligopolies
        - Few Firms
        - Products can be heterogeneous or homogeneous
        - High Barriers to Entry and Exit
        - Downward sloping demand curve
        - Price Setters
        - Profit > = zero
        - Marginal Revenue = MC
        - Strategic competition
        - incomplete knowledge
        - semi-efficient
        - Interdependence of firms
    - Monopolies
        - one firm
        - Barriers to entry
            - patents
            - economies of scale
        - Downward sloping demand curve
        - Price setters, profit > zero
        - MR = MC
        - inefficient
        - no competition
        - proprietary knowledge
    - Contestable Markets
        - 
- How is innovation related to market structure?
    - what was the example of corn framer showing?
        - (Perfect Competition) There was no period of appropriablility
          therefore he doesn't have a reason to innovate
        - if there is a period then he can recoup the costs of innovation
        - note that society benefits if the farmer innovates
    - Perfectly competitive
        - Supply increases, knowledge is shared (perfect knowledge)
        - price drops, profit drops back to zero
        - The farmer incurred the cost of innovation
        - Therefore no incentive to innovate in a perfectly competitive market
    - Monopoly
        - little incentive to innovate
        - positive profits
        - they are able to recoup their R&D costs and so sometimes engage in R&D
    - Oligopolies
        - Fertile ground for innovation
        - If they don't innovate, they DIE
        - When they don't innovate, their future profits go to zero and they get
          behind other firms
- How do these Markets (private/public) differ
    - Not enough incentive for the private market
        - risk
        - positive externalities
        - this is why we have patents
    - 
- What are the problems with using static Supply & Demand models for modeling innovation?
    - There is no need for the firm to spend money on R&D because they only
      optimize over one period (i.e. one quarter)
    - The benefits of R&D comes in the future but the costs occur today
    - innovation is dynamic
    - cannot tell the difference right now
    - A static model cannot show for why a firm would innovate
- Why has capitalism been so successful at fostering innovation?
    - *new* consumers' goods
    - *new* methods of production or transportation
    - *new* markets
    - *new* forms of industrial organization
    - to succeed at capitalism, innovation must take place
    - Because it has the following attributes
        - Oligopolistic competition
        - Routinization of innovation
            - Engineers are expected to improve technologies
        - Productive entrepreneurship
        - the rule of law
            - property rights
            - magna carta
        - Technology selling & trading
            - Market economy
- What are the inefficiencies of capitalism in regard to innovation and economic
  growth?
  - Consumers are driving firms, and may not necessarily chose the best product
  - R&D is sometimes duplicated
  - Not enough R&D is done

- What is Creative Destruction (CD)?
    - incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly
      destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one
- What are the drawbacks for an economy with CD?
    - SKIP
- What role does risk play in innovation?
    - Makes firms diversify
    - Introduces collaboration to share the risk with others and joint ventures
    - Risk leads to underinvestment
- In the face of uncertainty, how can a firm decide on whether or not to proceed
  with an innovation project?
  - Compute Rate Of Return

        delta V / V_i

    - V_i is the investment in an R&D project
    - V_f is expected gross payoff

    - However since innovation is uncertain, we do not know V_f so we need to
      use expected value (E(V_f))

        E(V_f) - V_i / V_i = EVProject / V_i

- Why routinize innovation?
    - Product improvement
        - most innovates are not ground breaking
        - innovation is the main competitive weapon of high-tech firms
    - increased reliability
    - enhanced user-friendliness
    - search for new uses
    - Routine R&D reduces the firms risk of innovating

Dissemination of TEchnology and Collaboration
=======

Collaboration between innovative firms
------

Patent issues make it required

Consortiums decrease licensing costs

Why must firms collaborate or die?
-----
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Time is important

Four Types of R&D Collaboration
-----
1. Patent Consortiums, standards adoption
2. 
3. Feedback,  really the same thing as 2
4. Chapter 4 in the book, universities holding patents, universities consulting

Foxconn, provides spillover to other firms sourcing with them

The larger the R&D firm the more likely for collaboration
    - more budget
    - combine with firms of similar size
    - small firm doesn't have as much patents
    - small firm has more risk
    - large firm can steal the small firm technology, and litigate/crush small
      firms

Innovation and dissemination
------
conflict --- you want profits, so you may want patents which goes against
dissemination

Empirical evidence
------
Competitve entry, time it takes for someone else to come up with a similar
product to compete with the original work

Incentives for voluntary dissemination
------
### Technology license markets
1. patents are scarce
2. 

Firms will choose option in their best interest

Technology licensing
------
Common to license and still make a profit

The complex networks do the most efficient allocation for each node

### Why don't firms copy technology?

Captures spillovers, (negative externality?)

Benefits of technology consortia
-----
Repetition makes possibility of screwing your neighbor less. (Game theory)

Technology Consortia in Practice
------

Why join?
------

The Technology Consortium Model
-----

1. Each innovation is slightly different, but complementary, important for the
   model to work
2.
3.
4.

####Model Params
Variable costs

    TC = VC + TC
    TC = C(y) + x 

Perfect competition model, so straight across Demand curve

*Know* that the firms participating are more profitable

Compounding effect between the difference in the hold out firm and the consortium
costs.

Welfare Gains from Consortium
