According to Nakamura,....
Developed countries are so far ahead in R&D and Universities and assets are so
far ahead that the gap is increasing

Review Questions - Economic Models
-------
- Traditionally, how has tech been treated in economic models?
    - It has been treated as an external factor, a constant in a formula
- How do market structure models differ?
    - Perfect Competition
        - No barriers to entry: Equal access to inputs and technology (i.e. patents)
        - Identical goods
        - Perfect information: All market participants know prices (input prices, output
          prices, etc.
        - Many buyers and sellers
        - No uncertainty 
        - Firms are price takers (its actions cannot impact market price)
            - Horizontal demand curve
        - MC = MR = Price, therefore profit = 0
        - Transactions are costless
        - Efficient outcome
        - Many small firms
    - Oligopolies
        - Few Firms
        - Products can be heterogeneous or homogeneous
        - High Barriers to Entry and Exit
        - Downward sloping demand curve
        - Price Setters
        - Profit > = zero
        - Marginal Revenue = MC
        - Strategic competition
        - incomplete knowledge
        - semi-efficient
        - Interdependence of firms
    - Monopolies
        - one firm
        - Barriers to entry
            - patents
            - economies of scale
        - Downward sloping demand curve
        - Price setters, profit > zero
        - MR = MC
        - inefficient
        - no competition
        - proprietary knowledge
    - Contestable Markets
        - 
- How is innovation related to market structure?
    - what was the example of corn framer showing?
        - (Perfect Competition) There was no period of appropriablility
          therefore he doesn't have a reason to innovate
        - if there is a period then he can recoup the costs of innovation
        - note that society benefits if the farmer innovates
    - Perfectly competitive
        - Supply increases, knowledge is shared (perfect knowledge)
        - price drops, profit drops back to zero
        - The farmer incurred the cost of innovation
        - Therefore no incentive to innovate in a perfectly competitive market
    - Monopoly
        - little incentive to innovate
        - positive profits
        - they are able to recoup their R&D costs and so sometimes engage in R&D
    - Oligopolies
        - Fertile ground for innovation
        - If they don't innovate, they DIE
        - When they don't innovate, their future profits go to zero and they get
          behind other firms
- How do the private and public markets for innovation differ? Why?
    - Not enough incentive for the private market
        - risk
        - positive externalities
        - this is why we have patents
    - COME BACK TO
- What are the problems with using static Supply & Demand models for modeling innovation?
    - There is no need for the firm to spend money on R&D because they only
      optimize over one period (i.e. one quarter)
    - The benefits of R&D comes in the future but the costs occur today
    - innovation is dynamic
    - cannot tell the difference right now
    - A static model cannot show for why a firm would innovate
- Why has capitalism been so successful at fostering innovation?
    - *new* consumers' goods
    - *new* methods of production or transportation
    - *new* markets
    - *new* forms of industrial organization
    - to succeed at capitalism, innovation must take place
    - Because it has the following attributes
        - Oligopolistic competition
        - Routinization of innovation
            - Engineers are expected to improve technologies
        - Productive entrepreneurship
        - the rule of law
            - property rights
            - magna carta
        - Technology selling & trading
            - Market economy
- What are the inefficiencies of capitalism in regard to innovation and economic
  growth?
  - Consumers are driving firms, and may not necessarily chose the best product
  - R&D is sometimes duplicated
  - Not enough R&D is done
  - COME BACK TO
- What is Creative Destruction (CD)?
    - incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly
      destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one
- What are the drawbacks for an economy with CD?
    - Being creative is risky
        - Risk discourages people from being creative
    - Creativity puts existing products at risk
        - producers
        - consumers
        - Good existing products may get replaced
    - Future creativity is hard to predict
        - Hard to know how long its gonna take to pay back
    - Creativity is hard to value
        - Time (we only learn the true value over time)
        - Measurement (Intangible creativity)
    - Creative Destruction may promote inequality
        1. Creative Types are rewarded
        2. Sustains worldwide inequality - barriers to entry - countries cannot
           catchup
- What role does risk play in innovation?
    - Makes firms diversify (hedge their bets/risk on multiple products)
    - Introduces collaboration to share the risk with others and joint ventures
    - Risk leads to underinvestment
    - Can be a Barrier to entry, increased cost for R&D
    - Firms use routinization
- In the face of uncertainty, how can a firm decide on whether or not to proceed
  with an innovation project?
  - Compute Rate Of Return

        delta V / V_i

    - V_i is the investment in an R&D project
    - V_f is expected gross payoff

    - However since innovation is uncertain, we do not know V_f so we need to
      use expected value (E(V_f))

        E(V_f) - V_i / V_i = EVProject / V_i

    - Also when there are multiple outcomes: 

        EV = (Probability1 x Expected Payoff1) + (Prob2 x EP2) + …. + (ProbN x EPN)

- Why routinize innovation?
    - Product improvement
        - most innovates are not ground breaking
        - innovation is the main competitive weapon of high-tech firms
    - increased reliability
    - enhanced user-friendliness
    - search for new uses
    - Routine R&D reduces the firms risk of innovating
- What role do sunk costs play?
    - Sunk costs create a barrier to entry that allows the possibility of
      positive profits to the industry
    - Minor sunk costs force profits to zero (Perfect Competition)
    - Major sunk costs equal barriers to exit and high risk of entry
    - Impact decision making
- How does the idea of routinization of innovation conflict with the Schumpertian view?
    - routine innovation tends to limit the resulting profits, which contrasts
      with Schump's idea of extraordinary profits.
- What is the arms-race model?
    - Profit maximizing firm will adopt the quantity of R&D at which marginal
      profit yield is zero
    - Magnitude of profit depends on the behavior or industry firms (level of
      competition)
    - no firm wants to fall behind
    - temporary equilibriums in R&D expenditures
    - and then sudden increases
    - Short term decrease in R&D allows for high profits but in the long term
      you will go out of business
    - If one business increases their R&D then other businesses will have to
      increase as well.
    - It benefits society for businesses to increase R&D spending.
- How does technical change influence GDP?
    - These things magnify the contribution of technical change to GDP
        - creative knowledge cumulation
        - spillovers
        - steady R&D spending -> GDP growth
        - increases in R&D spending -> faster rate of GDP growth
    - Eventually, diminishing returns to R&D might halt technical change
      contribution to GDP growth
- What role can the entrepreneur play in technological growth?
    - *The entrepreneur is the independent innovator*
    - they can be innovative but not productive for society (i.e. money
      laundering, drug cartels)
    - Most economic theory ignores entrepreneurs (they're hard to model)
    - they are vital for economic growth
        - they create products from the epistemic base
        - fuel innovation
    - COME BACK TO
- What factors influence the entrepreneur's activities?
    - Mores - attitudes about "acceptable" behavior
    - Good institutions
        - transparent government
        - checks and balances
        - They make it less risky to innovate!
    - set of laws and rule of law
        - private property
        - enforceable contracts
        - They make it less risky to innovate!
    - Security
- Why is capitalist growth seen as evolutionary?
    - prior to the industrial revolutions, world-wide growth was stagnant
    - capitalism brought about constant growth
    - COME BACK TO
- How was innovation and growth in Ancient Greece, Rome, the Middle Ages, China?
    - Ancient Greece (slavery)
        - Slavery
        - Chasm between classes
        - low opinion of productive work
        - social position dictated by things such as ethnicity
    - Rome (Violence)
        - Sought wealth through rent seeking and destructive enterprise
        - novelty was discouraged, imitation was preferred
    - Medieval China (corruption)
        - monarch could claim any property
        - entrepreneurship wanted to gain government positions
        - no competitive market
    - Servile England (taxation)
        - 80% of labor force in agriculture
        - high taxes by the nobility class
        - nobility thought innovation would curve their powers

- What factors led to the Industrial Revolution?
    - First Industrial Revolution (1760 - 1830)
        - new emphasis on knowledge
        - improved institutions
        - increased productivity of textbooks
        - *Did not run into diminishing returns*
    - Second Industrial Revolution (1860 - )
        - R&D emerges, less experimental, more directed
        - Access to knowledge
            - cheaper, faster, international
        - larger epistemic base increased likelihood of major inventions
        - British capital market
            - supplied capital for R&D
- What role does knowledge play for growth?
    - Epistemic Base
        - Def: Level of understanding
        - Two types
            - Propositional
                - What knowledge
                - right/wrong
                - discoveries
                - not patentable
                - example: Formula for calculating area of circle
            - Prescriptive
                - How-to knowledge
                - successful/unsuccessful
                - inventions
                - patentable
                - example: How to make steel
        - Increases economic returns but is subject to diminishing returns to
          scale
        - Each innovation/technique requires a minimum epistemic base, and
          requires widening for continued progress
- What is the Contestable Markets Model?
    - See next question
- How does this model differ from the Perfect competition model?

        Contestable market      Perfect Competition
        --------------------------------------------
        Many or few Firms       Large number of firms

        Economies of Scale      No economies of scale

        No Barriers             None
        to entry or exit

    - In contestable markets there are some small firms that can take a segment
      of the market away from big firms. 
    - There is a *repeated sinking of funds* in order to maintain a position in
      a contestable market - does not prevent entry
    - *NOTE* we use the contestable market model for high technology firms
    - Cannot adopt prices that yield super-profits
        - This would encourage entrants with lower prices
    - No firm can operate inefficiently (for very long)
        - Firm will be taken over or collapse
    - Each firm produces cost-minimizing output
        - The number of firms in the market will therefore be the number
          required to meet demand at minimum cost 
    - Customer demands will be fully met
        - Otherwise entry would occur in response to high prices
    - Often many cases of entry and many cases of failure
        - Entry is always a very risky undertaking!

- What drives the competition in this[Contestable Market] model?
    - The idea that anyone can enter, which causes incumbent firms to continue
      innovating to stay in the industry
    - Forces firms to be competitive
- What encourages entry into a contestable market?
    - Excessive optimism
        - promising new product
        - new tech?
    - Special advantage
        - talented employees
- What are the policy implications?
    - Price discrimination is often a feature of competitive innovation markets
    - Price discrimination does not always indicate market power
    - The number of firms in the industry does not always indicate market power
    - So?
        - Anti-trust laws?
        - growth policy?
- Why would firms want to collaborate?
    - lowers risk
    - the larger the R&D, the more likely the firm is to collaborate
- What types of firms collaborate?
    - The larger the R&D firm the more likely for collaboration
    - more budget
    - combine with firms of similar size
    - small firm doesn't have as much patents
    - small firm has more risk
    - large firm can steal the small firm technology, and litigate/crush small
      firms
- What can these collaborations look like?
    - With competitors
        - horizontal
    - With Suppliers
        - vertical
    - With Customers
        - vertical
    - With Universities and Research Centers
        - institutional
- Why would firms voluntarily pass proprietary technology to another firm?
    - Technology Licensing
        - More likely with small firms that don't have the supply chain, capital
          raising, and marketing capabilities of larger firms
    - Technology Sharing Consortiums
        - 
    - They choose the most profitable option (possibly both)
- What circumstances would lead to this?
    - Dunno
- Why do some firms form consortiums?
    - Advantage for participants by sharing R&D
    - Strong incentives to comply with agreements
    - Membership gives incentive to invest in  R&D
    - Result is a contribution to social welfare
    - Anti-trust must not interfere with tech consortium
    - *NOTE* they stay out of consortia to maintain superior profit from
      customer loyalty (e.g., Apple)
    - if innovations are perfect substitutes then there would be no incentive,
      I.E. innovations are heterogeneous, small improvements, that complement
      each other
- What is the Technology-Consortium Model?
    - Heterogeneous innovations
    - Inventions of separate firms are different from one another and complementary
    - Sharing firms can expect a positive net benefit from the information it
      obtains from other consortium members 
    - “Friendly transfer” faster than non-friendly information transfer 
    - Innovation reduces cost of production only
    - There are costs to technology transfer for the receiving firm, the process
      of imitation is not free

            x: expenditure on R&D
            n: number of participating firms
            r: expected return for R&D 
            s: cost reduction from other participants
            C(yP): Cost of producing y units for the participating firms
            C(yH): Cost of producing y units for the hold out firm

            TC = VC + TC
            TC = C(y) + x 

            Participants 1…n: TC = C(yP)[1-r-s(n-1)] + x
            Hold out firm:    TC = C(yH)[1-r] + x

            For the next term:

            Participants 1…n: TC = C(yP)[1-r-s(n-1)]^2 + x
            Hold out firm:    TC = C(yH)[1-r]^2 + x

    - Perfect competition model, so straight across Demand curve
    - *Know* that the firms participating are more profitable
    - Compounding effect between the difference in the hold out firm and the
      consortium costs.

- What effect does this inter-firm cooperation have on social welfare?
    - It helps
