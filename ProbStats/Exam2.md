Poisson - discrete
Exponential - continuous

Integrate the exponential function to get probability

did not need to integrate normal because we have the z table.

4, 5, 6.1 - 6.6

memorize Z = X_bar - u / (sigma / sqrt(n))

Bin equation has n choose k

use the empirical method for Confidence intervals
use tradtional method for hypothesis testing


Continuity correction on exponential.
